/*
*Problem
* Nightking wants to attack the kingdom and he really likes cold days. However, he doesnâ€™t want to attack the kingdom on the coldest day, because it is obvious.
* Instead, he will attack the second coldest day.
* Given an array A of N distinct integers where Ai represents the temperature forecast of the i-th day, You need to find the temperature of the day of the attack.
*
* Solution: we need to find the 2nd lowest element in the given array.
